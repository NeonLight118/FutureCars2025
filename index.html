                <p>Auto industry is always having a new technologies, whether for safety, entertainment, usefulness or simply for pure innovation. New Cars are built for safety and some of latest car innovations are exciting technologies that could revolutionize both automotive industry and human transportation, lots of ideas of some new technologies that will most likely make it into production(Christopher, 2016 April 4, para. 2). This research is going to focuses on autonomous vehicle, advantages, how to practice a safe autonomous and benefit of connecting self-drive cars with internet. Discovering new sources of fuels and create a clean diesel as fuel to reduce emissions and can people convert their old cars to a new one to be fueled with this new fuels. Could we create artificial planet to make natural gas to run future cars.</p>

                <p>Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has warned against the impending public health crisis with the auto industry hard-selling diesel cars. A rapid review of the car models on display in the recently concluded Auto Expo in the National Capital Region shows more than half of all new cars on display use diesel and more diesel models in both big and small car segments.  This is in complete disregard of the raging public health concerns around toxic diesel emissions that has led the  Supreme Court to crack down on diesel emissions from luxury diesel cars, diesel taxis and trucks and phasing in of environment compensation charge. It has also spurred the Union Government to consider advancement of Euro VI emissions standards to narrow the gap between petrol and diesel emissions (Anupam, 2016, para.1).</p>
                <p>CSE analysis shows this diesel drive is taking off when clean diesel fuel and technology have not been planned and committed to. The ongoing and stepped up dieselisation over the next five years will lock in enormous toxic pollution and lung cancer risk. WHO has included diesel emissions in the worst class of carcinogens for its strong link with lung cancer. Toxins are dangerous even at trace amount (Anupam, 2016, para.2).

	<p>Peidong Yang, a professor of chemistry at Berkeley and co-director of the school's Kavli Energy NanoSciences Institute, leads a team that has created an artificial leaf that produces methane, the primary component of natural gas, using a combination of semiconducting nanowires and bacteria. The research, detailed in the online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in August, builds on a similar hybrid system, also recently devised by Yang and his colleagues, that yielded butanol, a component in gasoline, and a variety of biochemical building blocks.(The Kavli Foundation , 2015, para. 1).</p>
    <p>  "Burning fossil fuels is putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere much faster than natural 
photosynthesis can take it out. A system that pulls every carbon that we burn out of the air and converts it into fuel is truly carbon neutral," added Thomas Moore, who also participated in the roundtable. Moore is a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Arizona State University, where he previously headed the Center for Bioenergy & Photosynthesis.(The Kavli Foundation , 2015, para. 4).
 Los angeles: Scientists have taken a big step towards creating artificial 'plants' that can use only sunlight to make gasoline and natural gas to run future cars without polluting the environment (The times of India, 2015 , para. 1).

Instead of sugars, however, synthetic photosynthesis seeks to produce liquid fuels that can be stored for months or years and distributed through existing energy infrastructure (The times of India, 2015 , para. 5).</p>

                <p>Semi-autonomous vehicles will likely be on the road before 2025, while fully self-driving cars should be shuttling people around by 2035. The firm predicted that the number of self-driving cars will jump from about 230,000 in 2025 to 11.8 million in 2035 - 7 million with driver controls and 4.8 million fully autonomous vehicles. (IHS Automotive, 2014).</p>
                <p>To increase efficiency, automakers have been looking to reduce car's overall    weight. The new materials that will be used are aluminum alloy and carbon fiber reinforced plastic, although they are stronger and lighter they're much more expensive for automakers. (Goldman Sachs, 2016). </p>
                <p>Connected cars, communicating with each other and with the larger world, will not only reduce accidents and ease traffic. They will have powerful effects beyond the auto industry. Insurers, for example, will have new ways to monitor driver behavior, reward good drivers and distribute costs to bad ones. And ride-sharing companies can better connect idle cars with the customers that need them. (Goldman Sachs, 2016). THE INTERNET OF THINGS DEMONSTRATES HOW CONNECTING EVERYDAY DEVICES TO A NETWORK TRANSFORMS WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THEM. THE INTERNET OF CARS WILL DO THE SAME. (Goldman Sachs, 2016)</p>
                <p>Connected cars—especially self-driving ones—could also change the way people use their drive time. In a 2013 survey, more than 50% of respondents said they would prefer to listen to music, talk on the phone, watch videos or browse the Internet while traveling by car. (Goldman Sachs, 2016).

	<p>This relates to autonomous technology, but it’s different because it’s the car actively disregarding your commands and making its own decisions. We’ve already got cars that will stop if you fail to apply the brakes. But by 2020 cars will apply the brakes even if the driver has the gas pedal floored. The rapid increase in sensor technology will force a shift in priority, giving the car final say — not you. (Forbes, 2015).</p>
    <p>Head-Up Display (HUD) technology has come a long way from the dim, washed out green digits some cars projected on their windshields 20 years ago. But as good as HUD is in 2015, by 2020 we’ll see active glass capable of displaying vibrant images. Imagine a navigation system that actually highlights the next turn (as seen from your perspective, through the windshield) as you approach it. (Forbes, 2015).</p>
    <p>You’re already getting Facebook, Twitter and Gmail ads based on your behavior. By 2020 the average car will be fully connected to the internet, meaning your vehicle will provide marketers with a powerful set of metrics to customize their message. Hopefully these will manifest as an opt-in feature, but get ready for personalized, location-based ads in your car’s display. (Forbes, 2015).</p>

                <p>The need for more fuel-efficient automobiles will greatly increase the cost
of parts—by more than $2,500 per vehicle. The businesses that supply
these parts will need to find ways to keep up with technology while
keeping costs down. While challenging, this situation also provides
opportunities for parts manufacturers. (Goldman Sachs, 2016).</p>
                <p>Flying cars don't exist but construction and battery materials are getting
so light that “micro-commercial aircraft” could serve as taxis. (psmag,
2014).</p>
	<p>With software and other technologies taking the lead, it’s no surprise that
consumer tech companies are entering the automotive world. While a car
may not be a mobile phone, these businesses’ focus on design, ease of
use, automated assistance and battery life will bring new kinds of
innovation to the field. (Goldman Sachs, 2016).</p>
	<p>Car ownership in most economies starts gaining momentum when per-capita
incomes move into the $10,000 to $20,000 range. By 2025, many developing
nations will reach that level for the first time, creating a large demand for
smaller cars with lower prices and lower operating costs. (Goldman Sachs,
2016).
